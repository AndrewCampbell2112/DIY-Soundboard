# DIY-Soundboard
This is a DIY soundboard where you can write in the local paths for your music/ sound files and have them easily play accessible all at once


Adding Sound Files:

  To add your sound file, in the code go to the next available button (ie. buttonOne on line 30) and change the text "buttonOne text" to the name of your sound. 
  You can then scroll down to where the button you have just changed to is (ie. buttonOne code starting at line 46) and change the text "LOCAL PATH TO FILE HERE" 
  to the path to your sound file (such as "C:\Users\Username\Sounds\mySound.mp3").

Playing Sounds Through The Mic:

  It is reccommended that a software such as Virtual Cable is installed and used to allow for the music to be played through the mic. On your music playing software, 
  go into the settings and change the defult output to "Virtual Cable In" and on your desired software, change your input to "Virtual Cable Out". You will also need 
  to have your mic feed into the virtual cable which can be done by going into your mic settings and turning on the option for "Listen to this device" and change the 
  Playback option to "Virtual Cable In".
